# ATS041 - Aion Fungible Token Reference Implementation


This project implements the Aion Fungible Token Java smart contracts following the [Aion Token Standard 041](https://github.com/aionnetwork/AIP/issues/41). This porject can be used directly to deploy fungible tokens on Aion Network. The deployment type is `0x2` since it is implemented in JAVA and is compatible with Aion AVM.
We recommend to use this project as the starting point for Aion Java Contract which will incorporate/extend fungible functionality.
